    <h2>Pimento Cheese And Heirloom Tomato Tart With Ritz Cracker Crust</h2>
    <h3><i>This could quite possibly be the best thing you make this summer.</i></h3>
    <br>
    <p>By <strong> Kelly Paige</strong></p>

    <p>What better way to celebrate tomato season than with a recipe highlighting summer’s finest offering? Heirloom tomatoes are gorgeous, juicy, come in a rainbow of colors and are packed full of delicious flavor.</p>
    <p>You might ask if these irregular-shaped beauties are actually worth the price tag. I once paid $8 for a single tomato at a farmers market and complained about it the whole way home, but after taking one bite I realized I would have paid $16 for it. And here’s why.</p>
    <p>Heirloom tomatoes are the cultivation of heirloom seeds that have been passed down for generations in a specific region and are purposely picked by a farmer for their unique characteristics. To be considered an heirloom, the seeds need to be at least 50 years old. 
       Fifty years ago, <a href="#">tomatoes</a> were grown for their flavor and not necessarily their appearance. It didn’t matter if they weren’t perfectly round, were bruised or had thin skins. What mattered was whether they tasted good.</p>
    <p>There’s a small window in the summer months to get these guys, so if you see them, pick them while you can. Look for tomatoes that are heavy for their size, are slightly firm to the touch, and have green stems and minimal abrasions.</p>

            <p><i>Makes 1 (9-inch) tart</i></p>
            <strong>Ingredients</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>2 sleeves Ritz crackers (about 7.5 ounces or 1 3/4 cup crushed crackers)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                <li>1 large egg white</li>
            
            <strong>Directions</strong>   
            <ol>
                <li> Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
                <li>Add crackers to bowl of food processor. Process until crackers are a fine crumb. Add Parmesan cheese, melted butter, egg white and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Process until evenly combined and mixture holds together when pressed between fingers. If it doesn’t hold together, add an additional tablespoon of melted butter.</li>
                <li> Tightly press mixture into bottom and sides of 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom. Tip: If the crust is not packed tightly, it will crumble when sliced. Use the back of a measuring cup to help really pack it down, as seen <a href ="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pimento-cheese-tomato-tart_l_5d3b34cce4b0a6d6373f0d8f">here</a>.</li>
